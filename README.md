Redcarpet is readily available as a Ruby gem. It will build some native extensions, but the parser is standalone and requires no installed libraries. Starting with Redcarpet 3.0, the minimum required Ruby version is 1.9.2 (or Rubinius in 1.9 mode).
```
$ [sudo] gem install redcarpet
```
In local folder run: 
```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 
$ ruby hdtest.rb
```

In your browser, run:
```
localhost:8000/test.html
```
